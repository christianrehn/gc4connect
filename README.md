To start the program connect GC4 with an Ethernet cable to your Laptop and run src/main/java/com/itestra/gc4connect/GC4Client.java

TODOs:
* instead of backspin and sidespin get or calculate total spin + spin axis because most golf ball flight models need it as input
* try to find the unknown values on ball and club display (not table)
* find a good golf ball flight model implementation
